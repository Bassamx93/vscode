# Hello World Extension

## Overview
This is a simple "Hello World" extension for VS Code that demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of a VS Code extension.

## Features
- Registers a command called "Hello World" that can be executed from the command palette
- Shows an information message "Hello World from VS Code!" when the command is executed
- Demonstrates basic extension activation and command registration

## File Structure
```
extensions/hello-world/
├── package.json          # Extension manifest
├── src/extension.ts      # Main extension code
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
├── .npmrc               # NPM configuration
├── .vscodeignore        # Files to exclude from package
└── out/                 # Compiled JavaScript output
    └── extension.js
```

## Key Components

### package.json
- Defines the extension metadata (name, version, publisher)
- Specifies activation events: `"onCommand:hello-world.helloWorld"`
- Contributes a command with ID `hello-world.helloWorld` and title "Hello World"
- Sets the main entry point to `./out/extension`

### src/extension.ts
- Exports an `activate` function that is called when the extension is activated
- Registers the command using `vscode.commands.registerCommand`
- Shows an information message using `vscode.window.showInformationMessage`
- Properly manages the command disposal through the extension context

## How to Use
1. Once VS Code is running with this extension, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "Hello World" to find the command
3. Execute the command to see the "Hello World from VS Code!" message

## Technical Implementation
- Written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Uses the VS Code Extension API (@types/vscode)
- Follows VS Code extension best practices for activation and cleanup
- Integrated with the VS Code build system (gulpfile.extensions.js)

## Status
✅ Extension structure created
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Command registration implemented
✅ Message display functionality implemented
✅ Integrated with build system
